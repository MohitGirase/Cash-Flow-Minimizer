# 🏦 Cash Flow Minimizer for Banks

This project implements a **Cash Flow Minimizer** algorithm designed for **inter-bank settlements**. The goal is to reduce the number of financial transactions required to settle outstanding amounts between multiple banks. When direct settlements aren't possible (e.g., differing transaction methods), the **World Bank** acts as an intermediary.

## 🌍 Overview

In a financial ecosystem with multiple banks, each bank may owe or be owed money by others. This tool efficiently resolves all such outstanding balances with the **minimum number of transactions**, ensuring smooth and optimized inter-bank settlements.

## 📌 Features

- Works with **net balances** between multiple banks.
- Uses a **greedy recursive algorithm** to minimize the number of transactions.
- Introduces a **World Bank** as a fallback when direct transactions aren't possible.
- Customizable for real-world banking settlement simulations.

## 💡 Concept

Each bank is assigned a net amount:
- Positive → the bank is owed money
- Negative → the bank owes money

The algorithm:
1. Identifies the **maximum creditor** and **maximum debtor**.
2. Settles the maximum possible amount between them.
3. Recursively repeats the process until all balances are zero.
4. If banks cannot directly transact (due to incompatible payment methods), the **World Bank** is used to route the payment.

## 📈 Example

**Input Balances (in millions):**
```java
Bank A: -50
Bank B: +30
Bank C: +20
```

**Output Transactions:**
```
Bank A pays Bank B: 30M
Bank A pays Bank C: 20M
```

If A cannot directly transact with B or C, the transaction is rerouted:
```
Bank A pays World Bank: 30M
World Bank pays Bank B: 30M
```
